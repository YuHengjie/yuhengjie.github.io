In this study, starch-based nanocomposite films reinforced by cross-linked starch nanocrystals (CSNCs) were successfully prepared. CSNCs were obtained by cross-linking reaction between starch nanocrystals (SNCs) and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP). Through the characterization and comparison of SNCs and CSNCs in microscopic morphology, degree of substitution, swelling degree, XRD spectrum, and FTIR spectrum, the successful progress of the cross-linking reaction was confirmed. Besides, the effects of adding CSNCs on physiochemical properties of the nanocomposite films including mechanical properties, water vapor permeability, and contact angle were studied. The results confirmed that CSNCs had good enhancement effects on the physicochemical properties of starch-based films due to the self-reinforcing effect, and when the CSNCs content reached 10%, the nanocomposite film had the best overall performance. We further evaluated the cytotoxicity of the nanocomposite. Taken together, it is believed that the reported self-reinforced starch-based films are very promising for food packaging and preservation.
