## Education background
Hi! I am a postdoc at Schoole of Engineering, Westlake University in Hangzhou under my advisor [Prof. Yaochu Jin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/yaochu-jin.html). I earned my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, Zhejiang University in 2024 under my advisor [Prof. Fang Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/fcheng). From January 2023 to January 2024, I was a full-time visiting Ph.D. student at the Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore under my advisor [Prof. Sam F. Y. Li](https://www.samlilab.com/).

## Research experience
While at Zhejiang University, my research interests were rooted in explainable AI applied to nano-plant-environment interactions and nano-enabled agriculture. These areas allowed me to combine my passion for computational methods with real-world agricultural challenges.

During my time at the National University of Singapore, I expanded my expertise by exploring the integration of explainable AI with metabolomics and environmental chemistry. This exploration was a fascinating journey into understanding complex biological and chemical processes through explainable data-driven insights.

Currently, I find myself increasingly drawn to the exciting realm of AI for Science. Witnessing how (explainable) AI is reshaping scientific research, I aspire to contribute to this evolving landscape, especially for the fields of protein, nanomedicine, healthcare, nano-enabled agriculture, etc. At the intersection of multiple disciplines, I am committed to finding key scientific problems and the most suitable (explainable) AI solutions. If you have ideas or projects that align with these interests, please do not hesitate to connect with me. I am always open to collaboration and eager to learn from others in this vibrant community.

I have authored seven publications and co-authored several publications in international peer review journals, please see [Publications](https://yuhengjie.github.io/publications/) for more details.
